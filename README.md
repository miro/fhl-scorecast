FHL Flowdock Scorecaster

This is a short nodejs-program that crawls through our NHL-tournament's Google Spreadsheet, finds new matches, and then posts the score of the new matches to Flowdock Team Inbox before restoring the matches to MongoDB.

See the [example spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/1fzyql7) which is in format that this app expects.
